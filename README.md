# COVID-Helper
## Our Project for hack-cessible
Seeing the results of 2nd wave of Covid, India has recorded 3 lakh case count which is the most by a country. Hospitals are running out of beds, there are people not getting enough resources and there are cases that hospitals are running out of oxygen and this has led to many deaths. Hence we have decided that a blog webapp helping people to get various leads or posting leads verified by them.

This Flask webapp will help people to post what they  need, where they need, and any other relevant detail along with their contact details. Those who are in possession of these items can look at our web app and deliver these items to those who need them.
